# Modelproject

The goal of this project is to model how two firms determine the efficient amount of a good to produce in a Cournot competetition. The model that we use is later extended with an additional firm. The Nash equilibrium is found by using optimization.

To produce our results you should run the file "Modelproject dsd hand-in.ipynb", which is found in the following folder:
"project-2019-dsd/modelproject".

The file should be run in jupyter lab, as it contains different visualizations and interactive widgets.
