# Dataproject

Data has been downloaded from the World Bank (API).

In our dataproject we look at GDP per capita and population in the major regions of the world in the period 1970-2015. We look at the growth rates that the regions have experinced in the period, and do our best to explain why we see the patterns that exist. We start out showing the development of GDP per capita and population in levels, then move on to show the relative development and finally we show 5-year growth rates.

Our python file is named "DataprojectDSD.py" and can be found in the subfolder "dataproject". The results are shown in the notebook "Dataproject dsd hand-in.ipynb", though our interactive dropdown widget does not seem to function, when opened in github, which should be noted. By running our python file "DataprojectDSD.py" in jupyter lab, the dropdown menu will show.

We have constructed an interactive binder where you hopefully can see open the notebook and also see the dropdown menus.
